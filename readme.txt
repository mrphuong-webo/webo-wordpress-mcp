== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which endpoint should MCP clients use? =
Use POST /wp-json/mcp/v1/router.

= Can this run WordPress abilities by itself? =
Yes. This plugin bundles Abilities API via Composer and auto-bridges registered abilities to MCP tools. You can disable auto-bridge with filter webo_wordpress_mcp_auto_bridge_abilities set to false.

= Can I expose internal tools? =
Yes, via filter webo_wordpress_mcp_allow_internal_tools in private environments.

= Can I limit public tools by category? =
Yes, via filter webo_wordpress_mcp_public_categories.

= Can I keep only WordPress.org-safe features? =
Yes. Default bridge rules exclude patterns for bulk, plugins/themes, and multisite abilities.

= Is this plugin suitable for production? =
Yes, when used with proper authentication, TLS, and a limited tool exposure policy.
