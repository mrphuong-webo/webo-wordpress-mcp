Public MCP JSON-RPC gateway for WordPress with tool registry, tools/list discovery, tools/call execution, and session security.

== Description ==

WEBO WordPress MCP provides a public MCP gateway for WordPress via JSON-RPC:

- Endpoint: POST /wp-json/mcp/v1/router
- Methods: initialize, tools/list, tools/call
- Public tools policy with category and allowlist filters
- Optional API key and HMAC authentication for tools/call
- Session lifecycle for MCP clients

This plugin is designed as the public gateway layer. Advanced/internal abilities can be bridged by companion plugins (for example WEBO MCP) using the provided registry hooks.
